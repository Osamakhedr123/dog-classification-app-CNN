# Dog Bread Classification App Algorithm using CNNs

At the end of this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed among 133 breads. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.\
I built two models in this notebook; one from scratch and another one using transfer learning which provided an accuracy of 81%.
